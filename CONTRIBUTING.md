## Notes about branches

This project follows the principles of the [GitFlow branching model](http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/) as [proposed by Vincent Driessen](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). According to this model you will find these branches at the GitHub project page:

-   The [master branch](https://github.com/OpenIndex/JavaMacLauncher/tree/master) contains the current stable releases. No development is directly taking place in that branch.
     
-   The [develop branch](https://github.com/OpenIndex/JavaMacLauncher/tree/develop) represents the current state of development. Changes from this branch are merged into [master](https://github.com/OpenIndex/JavaMacLauncher/tree/master) when a new version is released.
    
-   For more complex features you may also find different feature branches. These are derived from [develop branch](https://github.com/OpenIndex/JavaMacLauncher/tree/develop) and are merged back / removed as soon as the feature is ready for release.

> **Notice:** If you like to provide changes to this project, you should always use the [develop branch](https://github.com/OpenIndex/JavaMacLauncher/tree/develop) as basis for your customization. Feel free to create separate feature branches for any custom feature you like to share.
